## Yet another irc bot

Yeah, but this one is cooler, that's a rpg one, there are dices and bans \o/

## Compilation

We use gradle, to manage our dependencies. We use the [h2 db engine](http://www.h2database.com/) and the
[kitteh irc lib](https://github.com/KittehOrg/KittehIRCClientLib).

`gradle build` should get you a fresh build in the `build/libs/` folder.
