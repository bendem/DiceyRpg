## Yet another irc bot

Yeah, but this one is cooler, that's a rpg one, there are dices and bans \o/

## Compilation

We use gradle, I have no idea how it works so if it doesn't build with
``gradle``, I have no idea why.

## License

We asked a bot, he chose MIT:
```
[16:37:31] <@bendem> `choose MIT, Apache
[16:37:32] <Georges> bendem, MIT
```
